Our recently published paper, [Genomic epidemiology of the first two waves of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada](https://elifesciences.org/articles/73896), has led to some media interest and interviews where I have been asked to summarize our findings and give my opinion on various COVID-19 policies. I have tried my best to keep my opinions within the scope of our findings, but it can be hard to disentangle personal beliefs on the effectiveness and shortcomings of COVID-19 public health interventions. The most enjoyable media conversation I had was with Ben O'Hara-Byrne for his podcast 'A Little More Conversation', which can be streamed [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/how-effective-were-travel-restrictions-at-reducing/id1604604064?i=1000575608818) through Apple podcasts, although possibly on other podcast streaming platforms. 

We also had a featured article on CTV news, which can be found [here](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/travel-restrictions-drastically-cut-down-on-covid-19-entering-canada-early-in-pandemic-but-didn-t-stop-new-outbreaks-study-1.6012105?fbclid=IwAR1T582xf2avHUbYvl8HkQGpsnVbeKKfrZ-ajC6tVQLNpa9qBvRpy5jw-C8)

A little shameless self-promotion never hurt anybody, right?
