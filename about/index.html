	<p>My research interests focus on discerning the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens, primarily SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1, using a combination of phylogenetics and traditional epidemiological surveillance. Resolving transmission and migration differences in space and time allows us to evaluate whether public health interventions were effective or not. </p>
	<p>I am currently working towards my PhD in Bioinformatics at University of British Columbia (expected graduation Sept 2023) and am employed as a Research Assistant at the Molecular Epidemiology and Evolutionary Genetics group at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p>I previously receieved a MSc in Population and Public Health and a BSc Microbiology and Immunology. In what feels like a former life (AKA 5 years ago...), I specialized in biotechnology and stem cell research.</p>
	
	<h2>Current projects</h2>
	
	<h3>Phylogeographic modelling of the migration and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada</h3>
	<p2>We are developing genomic surveillance techniques to reconstruct viruses' origins in order to infer the number, origin, destination, and descendants of SARS-CoV-2 importations into Canada. By quantifying the relative contribution of international and domestic transmission sources over time by province, we are able to draw conclusions about whether non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as restriction of non-essential travel, were effective. Furthermore, this framework of tracking sublineages facilitates a higher resolution understanding of viral evolution occuring on home soil. Future work includes better characterizing how VOCs displaced previously circulating lineages, how they dispersed, and to what extent their transmission is attributable to unvaccinated individuals. </p2>
	
	<h3>Evaluting the effect of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) on HIV-1 transmission dynamics</h3>
	<p2>We are interested in how the availability of PrEP has caused differential reductions in HIV-1 transmission in British Columbia. </p2>
	
	<h3>Optimizing phylogenetic clustering criteria towards prioritizing subpopulations at-risk of ongoing transmission</h3>
	<p2></p2>
	
	<h3>Relative sensitivity of viral diversification rate and phylogenetic clustering to incomplete sampling</h3>
	<p2></p2>
	
	<h3>Exploring the identifiability of Bayesian phylodynamic models for epidemiological inferences</h3>
	<p2></p2>
