	<p>My research interests focus on deciphering the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens, primarily SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1, using a combination of phylogenetics and traditional epidemiological surveillance. Resolving transmission and migration differences in space and time allows us to evaluate whether public health interventions were effective or not. </p>
	<p>I am currently working towards my PhD in Bioinformatics at University of British Columbia (expected graduation Sept 2023) and am employed as a Research Assistant at the Molecular Epidemiology and Evolutionary Genetics group at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p>I previously receieved a MSc in Population and Public Health and a BSc Microbiology and Immunology. In what feels like a former life (AKA 5 years ago...), I specialized in biotechnology and stem cell research.</p>
